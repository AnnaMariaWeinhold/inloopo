                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

                        Disclosure of hypothetical performance: CFTC Rules 4.41 - Hypothetical or Simulated performance
                        results have certain limitations, unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not
                        represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have
                        under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of
                        liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are
                        designed
                        with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is
                        likely to
                        achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.</p>
