                    which adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Paphos,
                    Cyprus. The language of the proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of substantive law shall
                    be the law of Cyprus.</p>

                <h3 class="article__heading-three">Restrictions</h3>
                <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
                    individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
                    proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
                    basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
                    to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
                    persons.</p>

                <h3 class="article__heading-three">Exceptions to informal negotiations and arbitration</h3>
                <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
                    informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
                    concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
                    related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use;
                    and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                    then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
                    found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
                    personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
