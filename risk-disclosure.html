                <p><strong>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described
                        below.</strong>
                    No representation is being made that any trading account will or is likely to achieve profits or
                    losses similar to those shown, in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical
                    trading performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading
                    program.</p>
                <p>One of the limitations of hypothetical trading performance results is that they are generally
                    prepared the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial
                    risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in
                    actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading
                    program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual
                    trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the
                    implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the
                    preparation of hypothetical forex trading performance results, and all of which can adversely affect
                    actual trading results.</p>
                <p>Past results of Inloopo are not indicative of future performance.</p>
                <p>The monthly and composite annual results should be viewed as hypothetical.</p>
                <p>In reality, the results do not represent the track record of the methodology originator or
                    subscribers. This also means there is no guarantee that one applying these methodologies would have
                    the same results as posted. Since trading and investing successfully depends on many elements
                    including but not limited to a trading methodology and trader’s on psychology, our website does not
                    make any representation whatsoever that the above mentioned trading or investing systems might be or
                    is suitable or profitable for you.</p>
                <p>In addition, it’s important to understand and accept that there can be data outages and server
                    failures. The brokers system might not be functional, the auto trading servers might have technical
                    difficulties and there may be times where communication between accounts, the broker and the
                    auto-trade program are not functioning properly. This can lead to greater risk. Markets also do not
                    always guarantee exact fills. Periods of fast markets can cause greater degrees of slippage and less
                    than ideal fills. There can be no guarantee that your account will always be able to enter and exit
                    the programs ideal entry or exit point.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Futures Transactions</strong> in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take, delivery
                    of the
                    underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle the position with
                    cash.</p>
                <p><strong>They carry a high degree of risk.</strong></p>
                <p>The ‘gearing’ or ‘leverage’ often obtainable in futures trading means that a small deposit or down
                    payment can lead to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small movement
                    can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this can
                    work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions have a contingent liability and investors
                    should be aware of the implications of this. In general, the value of a future depends upon price
                    movements in the underlying asset.
                    Thus, many of the risks applicable to trading the underlying asset apply equally to the future
                    applicable to such asset. Futures and ETF’s are also exposed to liquidity risk.
                </p>
                <h2 class="article__heading-two">CFTC Risk Disclosure</h2>
                <p>The following statement is furnished pursuant to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”)
                    Regulation 1.55(c). This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant
                    aspects of trading in futures, forex and options. In light of the risks, you should undertake such
                    transactions only if you understand the nature of the contracts (and contractual relationships) into
                    which you are entering and the extent of your exposure to risk. Trading in futures, forex and
                    options is not suitable for many members of the public. You should carefully consider whether
                    trading is appropriate for you in light of your experience, objectives, financial resources and
                    other relevant circumstances.</p>
                <p>The risk of loss in trading commodity futures contracts and foreign currency can be substantial. You
                    should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your
                    circumstances and financial resources. You should be aware of the following points:</p>
                <ol class="rights__list">
                    <li>You may sustain a total loss of the funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or
                        maintain a position in the commodity futures market or foreign exchange market, and you may
                        incur losses beyond these amounts. If the market moves against your position, you may be called
                        upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice,
                        in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the time
                        required by your broker, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for
                        any resulting deficit in your account.</li>
                    <li>The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant for trading futures and forex positions
                        are not protected by insurance in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the futures
                        commission merchant, or in the event your funds are misappropriated.</li>
                    <li>The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant for trading futures or forex positions
                        are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation even if the futures
                        commission merchant is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or
                        dealer.</li>
                    <li>The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant are generally not guaranteed or insured
                        by a derivatives clearing organization in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the
                        futures commission merchant, or if the futures commission merchant is otherwise unable to refund
                        your funds. Certain derivatives clearing organizations, however, may have programs that provide
                        limited insurance to customers. You should inquire of your futures commission merchant whether
                        your funds will be insured by a derivatives clearing organization and you should understand the
                        benefits and limitations of such insurance programs.</li>
                    <li>The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant are not held by the futures commission
                        merchant in a separate account for your individual benefit. Futures commission merchants
                        commingle the funds received from customers in one or more accounts and you may be exposed to
                        losses incurred by other customers if the futures commission merchant does not have sufficient
                        capital to cover such other customers’ trading losses.</li>
                    <li>The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant may be invested by the futures
                        commission merchant in certain types of financial instruments that have been approved by the
                        Commission for the purpose of such investments. Permitted investments are listed in Commission
                        Regulation 1.25 and include: U.S. government securities; municipal securities; money market
                        mutual funds; and certain corporate notes and bonds. The futures commission merchant may retain
                        the interest and other earnings realized from its investment of customer funds. You should be
                        familiar with the types of financial instruments that a futures commission merchant may invest
                        customer funds in.</li>
                    <li>Futures commission merchants are permitted to deposit customer funds with affiliated entities,
                        such as affiliated banks, securities brokers or dealers, or foreign brokers. You should inquire
                        as to whether your futures commission merchant deposits funds with affiliates and assess whether
                        such deposits by the futures commission merchant with its affiliates increases the risks to your
                        funds.</li>
                    <li>You should consult your futures commission merchant concerning the nature of the protections
                        available to safeguard funds or property deposited for your account.</li>
                    <li>Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a
                        position. This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit
                        (“limit move”).</li>
                    <li>All futures, forex and options positions involve risk, and a “spread” position may not be less
                        risky than an outright “long” or “short” position.</li>
                    <li>The high degree of leverage (gearing) that is often obtainable in futures and forex trading
                        because of the small margin requirements can work against you as well as for you. Leverage
                        (gearing) can lead to large losses as well as gains.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the risks noted in the paragraphs enumerated above, you should be familiar with
                        the futures commission merchant you select to entrust your funds for trading futures positions.
                        As of July 12, 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission requires each futures commission
                        merchant to make publicly available on its Web site firm specific disclosures and financial
                        information to assist you with your assessment and selection of a futures commission merchant.
                    </li>

                    <p class="rights__p--caps">ALL OF THE POINTS NOTED ABOVE APPLY TO ALL FUTURES AND FOREX TRADING
                        WHETHER
                        FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE CONTEMPLATING TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS
                        CONTRACTS, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL RISKS:</p>

                    <li>Foreign futures transactions involve executing and clearing trades on a foreign exchange. This
                        is the case even if the foreign exchange is formally “linked” to a domestic exchange, whereby a
                        trade executed on one exchange liquidates or establishes a position on the other exchange. No
                        domestic organization regulates the activities of a foreign exchange, including the execution,
                        delivery, and clearing of transactions on such an exchange, and no domestic regulator has the
                        power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign
                        country. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the foreign country in which
                        the transaction occurs. For these reasons, customers who trade on foreign exchanges may not be
                        afforded certain of the protections which apply to domestic transactions, including the right to
                        use domestic alternative dispute resolution procedures. In particular, funds received from
                        customers to margin foreign futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as
                        funds received to margin futures transactions on domestic exchanges. Before you trade, you
                        should familiarize yourself with the foreign rules which will apply to your particular
                        transaction.</li>
                    <li>Finally, you should be aware that the price of any foreign ETF, futures or option contract and,
                        therefore, the potential profit and loss resulting therefrom, may be affected by any fluctuation
                        in the foreign exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the foreign futures
                        contract is liquidated or the foreign option contract is liquidated or exercised.</li>
                </ol>

                        or
                        more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing
