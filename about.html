            <h2 class="blog__heading">About me</h2>
            <p>I like to function outside of the mainstream. Growing up, my parents laid the foundation
                for this: at home, there was no TV, only vegetarian food and no refined sugar.</p>
            <p>I moved out when I was 16 because I wanted to become a professional ice speed skater. However, (luckily)  it didn't
                work out
                that way. Later, during my studies, I started checking stock prices. My friends still
                like to make fun of this, but I was just so fascinated by how you could increase your money with the right decisions at
                the right time. My first
                stock, which my dad gave me at the age of 14, unfortunately went down the drain. But I have learnt a lot since then!</p>
            <p>I was told: earn money first! So I made a brief detour into the automotive industry working
                as an engineer and later as a team leader. It took me 7 years to get out again. Now I live in Cyprus
                with
                my wife and my two children. I am a trader, investor and entrepreneur. I am living my dream: I spend
                time with my kids, work flexible hours and live where I want to right now.
            </p>
            <p>My aim is to help everyone reach their financial goals. The best case scenario is that you can achieve your financial freedom too. It is not easy, but everyone can learn how to do it.
            </p>

                the important things in life: their kids, their life goals, their dreams, their friends...
                I am not in favour of using the
                money to promote consumption, but would like to help people achieve a modest and down-to-earth life with vision.

            <h2 class="article__heading-two">My Purpose</h2>
            <p>I am here to give you a guide for your investment decisions. Make it easier by using my knowledge for your activities in the
                stock market. If you are as passionate about it as I am,
                follow me and learn from my decisions. With my stock market indicator, I have developed a universal and
                inexpensive product, which everyone can use. Thus, it is possible to beat the market with minimal effort
                and with a minimal drawdown on capital.

                            and wait for perfection. I accept mistakes and correct them.</p>

                    contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or
                    more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing one's
                    financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with
                    sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of
                    future results.</p>

                    results have certain limitations, unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not
                    represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have
                    under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of
                    liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed
                    with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to
                    achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.</p>
